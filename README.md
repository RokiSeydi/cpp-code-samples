# cpp-code-samples

a collection of code samples written whilst learning C++.
The exercises cover different topics and aim to be progressively more complex (however the order of the folders is alphabetical!).

1. Calculator: the programme was created whilst learning: if statements and variables data types
2. Chips game: most complex game so far. It is a game where two players are assigned a random number of chips. The winner is the one with the least number
of chips in their file. Topics covered:
- functions;
- do/while and while loops;
- rand();
- if/else statements;
- refactoring;
- debugging;
3. Guessing game: for this game, you have three attemps to guess the secret number. The game was created to practice: do/while loops, if/else statements 
and data types
4. Random day generator: to the question: what day does today feel like? the programme replies with a random day. I wanted to practice using: rand() and
switch statements
5. Passphrase guess: this is another variation of the guessing game. However for this one, I wanted to practice reading from an external file using the <fstream> 
library
